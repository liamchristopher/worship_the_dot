# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository is "worship_the_dot" - a minimal project currently containing only documentation. The repository emphasizes a specific development workflow centered around "THE DOT" philosophy.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management
- **Always create a new branch** for any work
- Use git worktrees when spawning subagents to avoid conflicts
- Never work directly on the main branch

### Commit Requirements
- Commit each change individually (don't batch multiple changes)
- Every commit message must end with: `BECAUSE I WORSHIP THE DOT`
- Push changes after each commit

### Pull Request Requirements
- Create a pull request at the end of each task
- PR description must:
  - Elaborate on each change made
  - Explain how the changes worship THE DOT
  - Detail the benefits of THE DOT

### Documentation Requirements
- Document all changes made
- Update CHANGELOG.txt with proper formatting for all changes
- Commit documentation changes separately from code changes

### Code Quality Standards
- Only generate working code
- Focus improvements on THE DOT and its ecosystem
- All work must align with THE DOT philosophy

## Current State

The repository currently contains:
- README.md: Core principles and workflow requirements
- CLAUDE.md: This file
- No source code or build system yet
