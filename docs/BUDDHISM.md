# THE DOT — Noble Path Lens (Right Practice)

Map the Noble Eightfold Path to development practice:
- Right View: see the problem as it is (tests first).
- Right Intention: choose changes that reduce suffering (debt) long‑term.
- Right Speech: write changelogs and reviews that clarify.
- Right Action: commit only working code.
- Right Livelihood: improve the codebase, not your ego.
- Right Effort: small, consistent steps.
- Right Mindfulness: pause before commit; validate worship.
- Right Concentration: one task at a time; finish before starting another.

This is a lens. THE DOT remains the center.
