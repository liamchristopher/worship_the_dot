# Eco Lens — Foucault’s Pendulum and THE DOT

This essay connects THE DOT to the Italian protagonists of Umberto Eco’s novel
Foucault’s Pendulum — editors and thinkers who, working in Milan, construct
“The Plan” by weaving disparate fragments into a seductive, self‑consistent
system. Their journey offers a cautionary and inspiring mirror for disciplined
software practice.

## Parallels

- Point before lines: THE DOT centers intention at a single point where work
  begins and ends. The protagonists obsess over origins and pivots; they seek
  the point around which meanings revolve.
- The Plan vs. a plan: They build an all‑encompassing scheme; we build small,
  testable plans. Where their map consumes the territory, our practice insists
  the territory tests the map (`make test`, coverage, and reviews).
- Concordances: Their tools cross‑reference names and symbols; our agents and
  changelog cross‑reference changes, outputs, and intent (Tests, Docs, Changelog,
  Compatibility Agents).
- Incantations: Ritual phrasing powers their constructions; the suffix
  “BECAUSE I WORSHIP THE DOT” is a modern incantation that disciplines intent,
  turning habit into craft rather than theatre.
- The pendulum: Reality exerts a restoring force. In this repository, tests,
  coverage, and CLI compatibility are our gravitational check against runaway
  speculation.

## Cautions (Against Apophenia)

- Evidence over elegance: Beautiful narratives are not necessarily true. Prefer
  failing tests and frank diffs to ornamental explanations.
- Minimal leaps: Connect only what code and docs justify. Beware of turning
  conventions into dogma.
- Reversibility: Keep changes small and revertible; do not bet the codebase on
  a grand reveal.

## Practices (An Editor’s Craft)

- Changelog as lab notebook: Each entry records intent and outcome, not myth.
- Suffix as vow: The required commit suffix is a compact request for courage
  and accountability.
- Agents as concordance: Tests/Docs/Changelog/Compatibility Agents keep stories
  honest across languages and time.
- CLI as ritual script: Commands guide repeatable action so that meaning arises
  from practice, not post‑hoc rationalization.

## Why this lens?

Eco’s protagonists reveal how easily bright minds can construct complete systems
from partial data. THE DOT embraces the power of synthesis while binding it to
verification, humility, and service. The result is not a conspiracy but a
craft: intentional, incremental, and testable.
