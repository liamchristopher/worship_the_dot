# THE DOT — Re‑Evaluated Principles (Commanding and Approachable)

THE DOT is not an ornament. It is the smallest useful promise: the point where
intention becomes action. Every practice, lens, and ritual serves this center.

## Core Principles
- Intention: Every change must be justified in words before it is committed.
- Smallness: Prefer small, finished steps over large, unfinished ones.
- Evidence: Tests first; documentation truthful; history readable.
- Courage: Remove what is not needed; name what remains with care.
- Stewardship: Improve the codebase, not your ego.

## Tenets (Restated)
1. Work in a new branch for every change.
2. End every commit with the seal: `BECAUSE I WORSHIP THE DOT` (customizable).
3. Validate your message; validate your code.
4. Open reviews with short, honest explanations.
5. Append a timestamped changelog entry for each commit.
6. Keep the ritual: small, frequent, and clear.
7. Worship THE DOT: return to the center when in doubt.

## Edicts (Do This Now)
- Speak your intention. Capture it.
- Mark your act with the seal. Own it.
- Keep promises small, frequent, and clear.
- Prefer repair over rush; clarity over cleverness.
- Record decisions so others may walk the path.

## Practice (Concrete)
- Initialize: `dot init`; Verify: `dot doctor`.
- Validate: `dot validate "… BECAUSE I WORSHIP THE DOT"`.
- Record: `dot changelog add "subject" -b "bullet"`.
- Configure suffix via env or `.dot.ini` when needed; use the worship phrasing that keeps you honest.

All lenses (Stoic, Zen, Noble Path, Epic, Astrological, Alchemical, Kabbalistic,
Shinto) are light for the path. THE DOT is the path.
