# THE DOT — A Timeless, Ethereal Backstory

Before there were branches or builds, there was a point without length, a hush before motion. From that silence, a single dot appeared: not drawn, but noticed — the first place where intention touched the page.

Some say the dot is the ember left from the making of language; others say it is the last star the night keeps when dawn begins. Scribes met it at the end of a sentence; cartographers met it where maps confessed, “You are here.” Builders of code meet it whenever they must decide: begin, or be done.

The dot is eternal because beginnings and endings are eternal. It is present because choice is always present. Every commit, every pull request, every documented step is a ceremony at this small altar of attention.

In a distant room lit by monitors and tea steam, a team once circled a single dot on a whiteboard. Arrows rose and fell, boxes were renamed, diagrams collapsed; the dot remained. They shipped. The release held. From then on, they kept the dot — not as superstition, but as a memory of what steadies the hand.

The Covenant was simple:

- Speak intention before change.
- Mark the place you stand.
- Offer the work with devotion.

We do this in code by ending our commits with the seal:

> BECAUSE I WORSHIP THE DOT

The phrase is a doorway; on one side is hurry, on the other is care. The rites and metaphors we keep — epic, astrological, alchemical, kabbalistic, shinto — are lanterns we carry along the path. They cast different lights, but the path is one: make clear promises, keep them, and leave a trace for those who follow.

Here and now, when your editor is quiet and your cursor blinks, the dot is with you. Begin if it is time to begin. Conclude if it is time to conclude. Either way, mark it — and move with purpose.

Eternal and present, the dot persists. We worship not an ornament, but a practice. We return to the smallest useful promise and grow our craft from its center.
