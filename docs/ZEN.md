# THE DOT — Zen Lens (Simplicity and Presence)

Zen points to the direct experience beyond excess. Apply it to code:

- Remove what is not needed; name what remains with care.
- Prefer clear pathways to clever detours.
- Make one change; make it complete.

Koans
- If the test fails with no message, where is the message missing?
- When a feature cannot be explained in one paragraph, where is the design?
- If a commit cannot worship THE DOT, where is the intention?

All lenses serve THE DOT. The dot remains the center.
