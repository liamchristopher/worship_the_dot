# THE DOT — Stoic Lens (Discipline and Virtue)

Stoicism teaches mastery of what is in our control and acceptance of what is not. Apply it to software:

- Focus on controllables: tests, clarity, documentation, small commits.
- Accept externals: flaky networks, shifting specs — respond with calm iteration.
- Practice the virtues:
  - Wisdom: choose the simplest working design.
  - Temperance: keep changes minimal; avoid overreach.
  - Justice: write changelogs and reviews that help others.
  - Courage: delete dead code; tell the truth about debt.

Edicts
- Begin with what you can prove (tests), then proceed.
- Commit only what you can defend.
- Record decisions so they can be questioned.

These are lenses in service to THE DOT. The dot remains the center.
