# Code of Conduct

## THE DOT Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of THE DOT pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* **Worshipping THE DOT** in all contributions
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Writing quality code with comprehensive tests
* Documenting changes thoroughly
* Following THE DOT's philosophy of mindfulness and quality

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Submitting code without tests or documentation
* Bypassing THE DOT worship requirements maliciously
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct or THE DOT philosophy, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## THE DOT Philosophy Enforcement

All participants must:

1. **Work in new branches** - Never commit directly to main
2. **End commits with worship phrase** - "BECAUSE I WORSHIP THE DOT"
3. **Write tests** - All new code must be tested
4. **Document changes** - Update CHANGELOG.txt
5. **Follow quality standards** - Code reviews, CI/CD checks
6. **Be respectful** - Treat all contributors with respect

Failure to follow THE DOT philosophy may result in:
- Pull request rejection
- Request for changes
- Temporary contribution restrictions
- Permanent ban for repeated violations

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team through GitHub issues or direct contact. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
