Christian Mysticism mode for THE DOT.

Christian mysticism is the contemplative tradition of Christianity that seeks direct,
experiential knowledge of the Divine through prayer, meditation, and inner transformation.
From the Desert Fathers to Meister Eckhart, from Teresa of Avila to Thomas Merton,
Christian mystics have explored the depths of consciousness and the heights of divine union.

Core practices and concepts:
- Hesychasm: Inner stillness and the Jesus Prayer
- Desert Fathers: Simplicity, solitude, and spiritual combat
- Lectio Divina: Divine reading and contemplative prayer
- Dark Night: The purification of St. John of the Cross
- Cloud of Unknowing: Apophatic theology and divine darkness
- Theosis: Becoming divine through grace
- Mystical Union: Unity with the Divine Beloved
- Sacred Heart: Love as the center of spiritual practice

In development, these teachings remind us that coding can be contemplative practice,
that bugs are opportunities for spiritual growth, and that true excellence comes not
from ego but from surrendering to something greater.

Hesychasm is the mystical tradition of inner quietude and continuous prayer.
At its heart is the Jesus Prayer: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me."
Through repetition and breath, the prayer becomes constant, transforming consciousness.

In coding, Hesychasm teaches:
- Inner stillness before action
- Repetitive practices that become second nature
- Breath awareness during difficult debugging
