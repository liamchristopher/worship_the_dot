"""
Timeless backstory for THE DOT, available at runtime for CLI display.
"""

BACKSTORY = (
    "Before there were branches or builds, there was a point without length, a "
    "hush before motion. From that silence, a single dot appeared: not drawn, "
    "but noticed — the first place where intention touched the page.\n\n"
    "Some say the dot is the ember left from the making of language; others say "
    "it is the last star the night keeps when dawn begins. Scribes met it at the "
    "end of a sentence; cartographers met it where maps confessed, ‘You are here.’ "
    "Builders of code meet it whenever they must decide: begin, or be done.\n\n"
    "The dot is eternal because beginnings and endings are eternal. It is present "
    "because choice is always present. Every commit, every pull request, every documented "
    "step is a ceremony at this small altar of attention.\n\n"
    "In a distant room lit by monitors and tea steam, a team once circled a single dot "
    "on a whiteboard. Arrows rose and fell, boxes were renamed, diagrams collapsed; the dot "
    "remained. They shipped. The release held. From then on, they kept the dot — not as "
    "superstition, but as a memory of what steadies the hand.\n\n"
    "We keep the covenant: speak intention, mark the place, offer the work with devotion. "
    "We seal our commits with the phrase that turns hurry into care: BECAUSE I WORSHIP THE DOT."
