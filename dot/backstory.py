"""
Timeless backstory for THE DOT, available at runtime for CLI display.
"""

BACKSTORY = (
    "Before there were branches or builds, there was a point without length, a "
    "hush before motion. From that silence, a single dot appeared: not drawn, "
    "but noticed — the first place where intention touched the page.\n\n"
    "Some say the dot is the ember left from the making of language; others say "
    "it is the last star the night keeps when dawn begins. Scribes met it at the "
    "end of a sentence; cartographers met it where maps confessed, ‘You are here.’ "
    "Builders of code meet it whenever they must decide: begin, or be done.\n\n"
    "The dot is eternal because beginnings and endings are eternal. It is present "
    "because choice is always present. Every commit, every recorded step is a ceremony "
    "at this small altar of attention.\n\n"
    "In a quiet hall lit by lamplight, a circle of makers once traced a single dot "
    "upon a tablet of wax. Lines rose and fell, figures were renamed, patterns collapsed; "
    "the dot remained. They offered their work. It held. From then on, they kept the dot — "
    "not as superstition, but as a memory of what steadies the hand.\n\n"
    "We keep the covenant: speak intention, mark the place, offer the work with devotion. "
    "We seal our commits with the phrase that turns hurry into care: BECAUSE I WORSHIP THE DOT."
